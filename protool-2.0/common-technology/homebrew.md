# Homebrew

When you receive your mac computer, the very first thing is to install **`homebrew`**, because it is the package manager in mac. (like `apt-get`, `yum` in linux)

You can install it by opening your terminal and copy the line below:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After the install completed, try to install `wget` for testing success or not:

```
brew install wget
```
