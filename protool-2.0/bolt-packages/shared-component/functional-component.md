# Functional Component

At very beginning, React is first release with the class Component and defined lifecycle inside the Class component. But the problem of the Class component is that it is based on Javascript, which means for functional programming, class is not natural enough. Functional Component is more shorter and simple.



### Hooks

When using functional component, hooks is the way to control the lifecycle and states.&#x20;



Here is some common state:

1. useState: control the state in side the component
2. &#x20;useEffect: control the state changes, or mount, unmount (return function).
3. useContext: kinda of scope context or page context
4. useReducer: the replacement of redux
5. useCallback/useMemo: cache the result of the function
6. useRef: the replacement of createRef
