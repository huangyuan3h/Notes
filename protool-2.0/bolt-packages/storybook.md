Let's take small tile as an example. As we can see, left side is the component we have, and for one component it is possible to have different form. At the top is a bar and the dropdown menu show the site we have. By clicking the site, the language and the style would be changed.

The bottom panel is action and control tabs. In control tab, it is much more to control the property, such as the number and title. In action tab, you can change the action that would be trigger by this component, such as click.
